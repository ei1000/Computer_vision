# Computer_vision
Using the freecodecamp course.

Im taking a course where we are creating a simple autonomous car, powered by a multiagent system. 

The system consists of primarilly a raspberry pi, an arduino uno, 2 motors and a camera. 

My goal of this project is to understand simple computervision, so that I could improve my car.
