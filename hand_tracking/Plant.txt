Use the MediaPipe from google

Hand tracking consist of palm detection and hand landmarks

- Palm detection works on complete image, and crops an image to the hand.

- Hand landmarks module maps the hand to different joints and points. Like where the wrist is, thumb tip etc.
    - Trained with 30 000 manually anotated images of hands. Prob croud sourcing. But large dataset, with consise anotaion is good.
    - Possibly make my own dataset and use MediaPipe on it. Anotation is dreadfull to do manually. Maybe train a simple model, and then use reinforcement to automate anotation.
